# NewsAPI Android App

The Android app is designed to fetch recent news articles using an API. This app provides users with the latest news updates on various topics, including sports, entertainment, politics, and technology. This was my first time using an API in Kotlin, it was a great learning experience. 


## Technologies

The app uses the following technologies:

- **Kotlin:** The app is built using Kotlin, a popular programming language for Android app development.
- **Android SDK:** The app is built using the Android Software Development Kit, a collection of tools and libraries for building Android apps.
- **Retrofit:** The app uses the Retrofit library to make HTTP requests to the NewsAPI API
- **Moshi:** is a JSON parsing library for Java and Android that allows developers to convert JSON data into Java objects. It is similar to other JSON parsing libraries like Gson, but it is designed to be faster and more memory-efficient.
- **RecyclerView:** The app uses a RecyclerView to display the news articles in a user-friendly format.
